# Personal Portfolio Web Page Created with React

This is a basic website with three client-side routes, each named Home, Projects, and Contact.

# Home

This is the landing page for the website, with a brief summary about me and my skills and objectives.

# Projects

This is where I showcase the repository links for some of my significant projects I have created.

# Contact

This is the page containing a contact form for clients and employers to contact me for services or to schedule interviews.

# Continued Editing

This project will continuously be updated as more projects are completed, or simply to add more features for a more dynamic user experience.
